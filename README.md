- Implement a Api only Rails App:
    - User model (use rails migration to create table)
    - User can update his/her profile with: full_name, avatar (use local active storage for upload file)
    - User can register/login/log out (manual api): register/login by email, password, use rails active model validation for check email exited when registration.
    - User can create/edit/delete a job:
        - With statuses: draft, publish (use enum)
        - A job have columns: status, created_by_id, title, published_date, share_link, salary_from, salary_to (salary in usd, use rails migration to create table)
        - User can view list of jobs that had been created by user(himself/herself)
        - User can edit/delete owned job
        - User can share a link to public with share_link defined.
- Notes:
    - Use jwt gem for authentication (registration, login, logout)
    - Use pundit gem for authorization
    - The public job share_link skips authentication so everyone can access job details.
